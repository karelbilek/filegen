generating docs and spreadsheets from templates


java thing for generating spreadsheets and docs from templates. It produces XLS,DOC,PDF,anything OpenOffice can produce.

the templates are ODF (for documents) and XLS (for spreadsheets). The data that are fed to the documents are JSON.

you have to run headless openoffice and hook it up to it.

not sure anyone will use it, there are probably better tools and I am too lazy to document it, I just needed to build it, I built it, and now I am just putting it out there

I am not versioning it or anything
